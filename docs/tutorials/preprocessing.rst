Before just measured spectra can be used for data analysis, they must be
first preprocessed. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use algorithms
from the biospectools package to preprocess spectra in different cases.

Standard spectral correction (EMSC)
-----------------------------------

Often measured spectra have only simple scattering effects such as
multiplicative, linear, and quadratic effects. In this case, the Extended
Multiplicative Scattering Correction (EMSC) method [Mart91]_ can be used to
remove linear and quadratic effects and normalize spectra.

>>> from biospectools import EMSC
>>> reference_spectrum = raw_spectra.mean(axis=0)
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference_spectrum, wavenumbers)
>>> corrected_spectra = emsc.transform(raw_spectra)

EMSC Framework
--------------

EMSC method [Mart91]_ helps to remove unwanted variation in spectra. First, it
decomposes spectrum into given components. One of the components must always
be a reference spectrum, while other components usually model variations in
raw spectra that need to be removed. Using the least squares method, EMSC
estimates the contribution of each given component. After the contribution of
each component is known, it reconstructs a spectrum using only
"good" components, i. e. removing unwanted components.

For example, The basic model described in the :ref:`section above<tutorials standard emsc>`
includes reference spectrum, baseline, linear and quadratic components
denoted below in bold as a :math:`\mathbf{reference}`, :math:`\mathbf{1}`,
:math:`\mathbf{\tilde{\nu}}`, :math:`\mathbf{\tilde{\nu}^2}`.
Their contributions are denoted as coefficients :math:`b`, :math:`a`, :math:`c`,
:math:`d`. The error term :math:`e(\tilde{\nu})` denotes all variation in a
spectrum that could not be represented with given components. Thus, from the
formula below we see that the corrected spectrum is like a raw spectrum but
without contibution of baseline, linear and quadratic components. In other
words, the corrected spectrum is a reference spectrum plus variation that did
not fit any other component (roughly speaking, chemical information)
normalized by a scaling coefficient :math:`b`.

.. math::

    spectrum(\tilde{\nu}) &= b*\mathbf{reference(\tilde{\nu})} + a*\mathbf{1} + c*\mathbf{\tilde{\nu}} + d*\mathbf{\tilde{\nu}^2} + ะต(\tilde{\nu}) \\
    corrected(\tilde{\nu}) &= \mathbf{reference(\tilde{\nu})} + \frac{e(\tilde{\nu})}{b}

`EMSC` class has a parameter ``poly_order=2`` that adds baseline, linear
and quadratic components. The parameter can be changed, for example, to
``poly_order=3``, then it will also add a cubic component ( :math:`\tilde{\nu}^3`).
Using higher-order polynomials in EMSC may help to model more sophisticated
scattering. However, too big polynomial order will make the
model so versatile that it may start to remove chemical information from
a spectrum, e. g. remove peaks. So it is always a tradeoff between removing
scattering features and leaving chemical information. As a consensus, a
default value ``poly_order=2`` is used often.

In the following sections, we will show how the EMSC model can be further
extended to perform spectra correction in more sophisticated cases.

Removing water/paraffin contribution (EMSC)
-------------------------------------------

In some cases, a sample may contain unwanted chemical components. For
example, biological samples may have water leftovers and
cancer tissue slides are usually embedded in paraffin. In those cases, the
contribution given by interferent components is irrelevant for the subsequent
analysis. It can be removed by the EMSC model extended with a spectrum of
unwanted chemical component [Solh22]_ [Afse12]_.

A list of unwanted chemical components can be passed to the `EMSC` model through
`interferents` parameter. Then during preprocessing, EMSC will remove those
interferents from spectra.

>>> from biospectools import EMSC
>>> reference_spectrum = raw_spectra.mean(axis=0)
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference_spectrum, wavenumbers, interferents=[paraffin])
>>> corrected_spectra = emsc.transform(raw_spectra)

Fringe correction (Fringe-EMSC)
-------------------------------

Samples in the shape of thin film (e. g. waxed tissue section, sample
slices), may have sine-like distortions in spectra, commonly referred to as
fringes. Fringes can be removed automatically by a Fringe-EMSC algorithm
[Solh21]_. For the estimation of fringe parameters, the algorithm requires a
wavenumbers range of a chemically silent region (usually 1800-2800 cm-1).

The example below shows spectra of hair cross-sections [Sand21]_. Hair
cross-sections have a thin-film shape, so we see fringes in the
spectra. We use Fringe-EMSC to remove fringes. In addition to standard
parameters, we are using weights to instruct the EMSC model to pay more or
less attention to some regions of the spectra [Solh22]_. Here we want to fit
fringes well while allowing more underfitting in absorption regions. In other
words, we want to ask the EMSC model to decompose a spectrum into components
that represent fringes well while only approximately representing absorption
regions. To achieve it, we set silent regions to have greater weight than
absorption regions.

>>> from biospectools import FringeEMSC
>>> reference = matrigel
>>> weights = np.full_like(wns, 0.1)
>>> weights[(wns > 1800) & (wns < 2800) | (wns > 3700)] = 1
>>> #
>>> femsc = FringeEMSC(
>>>     reference, wns, fringe_wn_location=(1800, 2800), weights=weights)
>>> corrected = femsc.transform(raw_spectra)

Mie scattering correction
-------------------------

Mie-type scattering often occurs in infrared microspectroscopy, where
measured samples are of microscopic size [Mohl05]_. At this scale, an infrared
spectrum shows not only the chemical properties of a sample but also its
morphological features like size and shape. Mie scattering may
affect the measured spectrum so strongly that its usual peaks get reversed, and
the absorbance spectrum starts to remind a transmission spectrum. Mie
scattering complicates the subsequent chemical analysis of samples and usually
should be removed by preprocessing methods.

Here is an example of a spectrum of a microplastic bead of 5.5 um diameter
(PMMA sphere) that exhibits strong Mie scattering features.

Model-based approach (ME-EMSC)
______________________________

ME-EMSC is a state-of-the-art algorithm for Mie scattering correction [Solh19]_.
It extends the EMSC model with Mie components that should fit Mie scattering.
ME-EMSC algorithm starts from a reference spectrum as a first guess and
then iteratively improves this guess until changes after the next iteration
become negligible. During each iteration ME-EMSC algorithm builds Mie curves
using physical theory (Mie theory). Those curves account for different
possible morphologies of a particle given its chemical properties (reference
spectrum). When the curves are built, ME-EMSC decomposes them into orthogonal
components that will be added to the EMSC model. Then, the raw spectrum gets
corrected, and the corrected spectrum becomes a new reference spectrum for
the next iteration.

>>> from biospectools import MeEMSC
>>> memsc = MeEMSC(reference, wns)
>>> corrected = memsc.transform(raw_spectra)

.. image:: imgs/memsc_correction.png
    :alt: Example of Mie scattering correction by ME-EMSC
    :align: center

Advanced usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our implementation of the ME-EMSC algorithm has three parts that can be
easily replaced: Mie curves generator, Mie curves decomposer, and a stopping
criterium.

Mie curves generator produces all possible measured spectra given pure
absorbance spectrum and wavenumbers. Mie decomposer given a list of Mie
curves produces components for the EMSC model to fit Mie scattering. Finally,
the stopping criterium decides when ME-EMSC got a precise enough answer to stop
the algorithm.

Those parts can be replaced by custom classes implementing specific interfaces:

>>> class CustomMieCurvesGenerator:
>>>     ...
>>>     def generate(self, pure_absorbance, wavenumbers):
>>>         ...
>>>         return simulated_mie_curves
>>> #
>>> class CustomMieCurvesDecomposer:
>>>     ...
>>>     def find_orthogonal_components(self, simulated_mie_curves):
>>>         ...
>>>         return components
>>> #
>>> class CustomStopCriterion(BaseStopCriterion):
>>>     ...
>>>     def _stop(self) -> bool:
>>>         ...
>>>         return is_stop
>>> #
>>> # set custom parts of ME-EMSC algorithm
>>> memsc = MeEMSC(reference, wavenumbers)
>>> memsc.mie_generator = CustomMieCurvesGenerator(...)
>>> memsc.mie_decomposer = CustomMieCurvesDecomposer(...)
>>> memsc.stop_criterion = CustomStopCriterion(...)

Deep learning approach (DSAE)
_____________________________

While the ME-EMSC method is suitable for preprocessing of thousand spectra,
it quickly becomes inconvenient to use with hyperspectral images. There are
two main reasons for that (i) it is slow, so preprocessing of 15000 spectra
may take about 1 hour; (ii) it requires a reference spectrum which is
especially problematic for hyperspectral images. To speed up the ME-EMSC
method, a neural network that predicts ME-EMSC correction results can be
trained (Descattering Autoencoder, DSAE) [Magn20]_. It proved to
automatically select a suitable reference spectrum from those used
for ME-EMSC correction. Additionally, it removes noise from spectra.

Training
^^^^^^^^

Usually, the DSAE model needs to be trained from scratch for each new problem. It
means that first, you will need to run ME-EMSC preprocessing for some small
part of your dataset, then train the DSAE model to predict ME-EMSC correction
given raw spectra, and then the DSAE model can be applied to the rest of the
dataset.

DSAE object builds a TensorFlow model, so `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials>`_
or `Keras <https://keras.io/examples/>`_ framework is required for training.
Here is a rough of example how this could be done:

>>> memsc = MeEMSC(reference, wavenumbers)
>>> corrected = memsc.transform(raw_spectra)
>>> # ...
>>> dsae = DSAE(wavenumbers)
>>> dsae.model.fit(x=raw_spectra, y=corrected, epochs=100)
>>> # ...
>>> dsae.transform(rest_of_the_raw_spectra, wavenumbers)

.. note::
    In case you are using a default DSAE architecture (as in example above),
    number of points in spectrum must be divisable by 64,
    i.e. ``len(wavenumbers) % 64 == 0``

Using DSAE pre-trained on filamentous fungi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, there is only one available pre-trained model of DSAE that was
trained on spectra of filamentous fungi Mucor circinelloides [Magn20]_. The
example below shows preprocessing of filamentous fungi spectra by the
pre-trained DSAE model.

>>> from biospectools import DSAE
>>> dsae = DSAE.pretrained_on_fungi()
>>> corrected = dsae.transform(mucor_circinelloides_spectra, wavenumbers)

.. image:: imgs/dsae_correction2.png

Advanced usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the ones who familiar with deep learning, it might be interesting to
tailor architecture by setting up parameters ``filters``,
``kernel_sizes`` and ``strides`` during DSAE initialization.

Replicate correction (EMSC)
---------------------------

Sometimes spectra may contain scattering features that cannot be explained
well by polynomial components, sine-fringes, or Mie curves. In this case, we
should somehow explain to the EMSC model "wild" scattering components. We can
obtain them utilizing differences in so-called technical replicates.
Technical replicates are repeated measurements of the same sample, so the
differences in them are mainly caused by scattering. The algorithm that
utilizes technical replicates for scattering correction is called replicate
correction [Tafi21]_. Here we will briefly go through four main steps and
show how each of those can be implemented with biospectools.

.. image:: imgs/replicate_correction.png
    :alt: Example of replicate correction method comparing to standard EMSC preprocessing
    :align: center

1) Calculate global scaling for each spectrum in the dataset

>>> from biospectools import EMSC
>>> #
>>> # dataset is pandas DataFrame with all necessary information
>>> raw_spectra = dataset[wavenumbers].values
>>> reference = raw_spectra.mean(axis=0)
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference, wavenumbers)
>>> _, dtls = emsc.transform(raw_spectra, details=True)
>>> dataset['global_scaling'] = dtls.scaling_coefs

2) Gather variation across different groups of technical replicates:

>>> replicate_variation = []
>>> #
>>> # suppose that spectra of technical replicates has the same replicate_id
>>> # wns = wavenumbers
>>> for repl_id, tech_repls in dataset.groupby('replicate_id'):
>>>     raw_tech_repls = tech_repls[wavenumbers].values
>>>     reference = raw_tech_repls.mean(axis=0)
>>>     #
>>>     emsc = EMSC(reference, wns)
>>>     corrs, dtls = emsc.transform(raw_tech_repls, details=True)
>>>     #
>>>     variation = corrs - corrs.mean(axis=0)
>>>     global_scaling = tech_repls['global_scaling'].values[:, None]
>>>     local_scaling = dtls.scaling_coefs[:, None]
>>>     scaled = variation * local_scaling / global_scaling
>>>     replicate_variation.extend(scaled)

3) Use PCA to calclulate principal components of gathered variation

>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
>>> pca = PCA()
>>> pca.fit(replicate_variation)
>>> n_components = np.sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum() < 0.95)
>>> scattering_components = pca.components_[:n_components]

4) Add scattering components to EMSC model as interferents

>>> reference = raw_spectra.mean(axis=0)
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference, wavenumbers, interferents=scattering_components)
>>> corrected = emsc.transform(raw_spectra)

Hyperspectral image correction
------------------------------

All the classes presented above are input-shape independent, i. e.
they can accept just one spectrum, list of spectra, or hyperspectral image.
Usually, the ``transform`` method assumes that the wavenumbers dimension is
the last one and preserves all other "spatial" dimensions.

Here is an example of preprocessing of a single spectrum and a hyperspectral
image with 128x128 pixels, where each pixel represents a spectrum with 3000
wavenumbers (points).

>>> single_spectrum    # shape (3000,)
>>> hyperspectral_img  # shape (128, 128, 3000)
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference, wavenumbers)
>>> corr_spectrum = emsc.transform(single_spectrum)  # shape (3000,)
>>> corr_img = emsc.transform(hyperspectral_img)     # shape (128, 128, 3000)

Separating sample from background
_________________________________

The estimated components' contributions bear practical information.
For example, the :ref:`scaling coefficient<tutorials emsc framework>` is
related to sample thickness. It shows how much spectrum contains the analyte
signal and, therefore, can be used for filtering low-signal spectra or sample
segmentation on a hyperspectral image [Tafi20]_.

In the example below, segmentation of hair cross-section [Sand21]_ was done
using the scaling coefficient estimated by EMSC model. When the ``transform``
method gets parameter ``details=True``, it returns a special object
EMSCDetails that provides access to coefficients.

>>> reference = hyper_img[40, 15]
>>> emsc = EMSC(reference, wns)
>>> corrected, dtls = emsc.transform(hyper_img, details=True)
>>> plt.imshow(dtls.scaling_coefs)

    :height: 300px

Segmentation based on known components
______________________________________

When one knows some chemical components in advance, their contribution can be
estimated through the EMSC algorithm [Solh22]_. The ``analytes`` parameter can
be used to account for the known chemical components in the EMSC model
without removing them. In contrast, components passed through the
``interferents`` parameter will be removed after correction. Adding analytes
to the model may help to stabilize it. The analytes' and interferents'
coefficients are available through the EMSCDetails object.

>>> emsc = EMSC(
>>>     reference, wns, analytes=[blood, connective_tissue],
>>>     interferents=[paraffin])
>>> corrected, dtls = emsc.transform(tissue_img, details=True)
>>> plt.imshow(dtls.analytes_coefs[..., 0])  # contribution of blood component
